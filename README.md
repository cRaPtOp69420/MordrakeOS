# MordrakeOS
⚠️⚠️RANSOMWARE⚠️⚠️
MordrakeOS is a "Virus" that should really be categorised as ransomware because it employs batch script. MordrakeOS's capabilities include changing backdrop, setting volume to 100 and opening an image of Edward Mordrake (thus the project name), it does these every .25 seconds while an audio file featuring various terrifying noises and a humorous sound effect plays. Open if you dare; since the batch file is "shortcutted" by the.vbs file, the batch file is absolutely unstoppable once it has started. I don't advise doing this to anyone besides testing the malware directly. By downloading the following files, you agree to use them at your own cost. Thanks!
